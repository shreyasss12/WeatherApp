# WeatherApp ☁

__Get the weather of any city you need whenever and wherever 🌩__



Things I learned from this project 👇

1.Connecting more than one javascript file to keep everything organized.💨

2.Fetching an API.📂

3.Async and Await.

I made use of openweather api to get the livetime weather of all the cities.
